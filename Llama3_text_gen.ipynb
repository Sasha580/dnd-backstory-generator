    "[Few-shot training](https://medium.com/@garysvenson09/how-to-implement-few-shot-learning-with-llama3-in-langchain-6b9cdf81a60d) is a machine learning technique where a model is trained or fine-tuned to perform tasks using only a small number of examples. This helps the model to generalize and adjust to new tasks with minimal data but still use prior knowledge at the same time."
