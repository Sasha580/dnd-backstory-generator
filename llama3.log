Surk initially turned to the monastery to hone his martial skills, but there he also found belonging in the simply life away from the headaches of responsibility.When word came to the monastery of new rumors of a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts, Surk felt a deeply rooted sense of responsibility stir for the people he was born, if not chosen, to lead.
He left his new home in search of this artifact with the blessing of his order going with him.
Surk lives a highly conflicted inner life.
He is content, happy even, with his life as a monk, though he still feels keenly the sting of not being good enough in the eyes of the Elder Council.
